This table lists all types of planets.

NOTE:
* detailed information about '''layers''' (which biomes can be on the surface/underground/core, etc.) is in another Cargo table (see {{Automatic layer info}}).
* detailed information about '''biomes''' (including primary biome!) is in another Cargo table (see {{Automatic biome info}}).

TODO: maybe add "possible_stars" list here? (normally we would create Cargo table for stars, but we don't really need any other information about them except "which planets can this star have").
